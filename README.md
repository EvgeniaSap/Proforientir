# Proforientir
Software package for monitoring the career guidance work of the university department
# Building and running the project
The software package was developed for use in a local network.

Import from the "ServerProforientir" folder the career_guidance.sql file containing the database of the software package. Then run the index.php file on the server.

Before running the application, find the units.txt file in the Proforientir project folder. In the units.txt file, enter the address of the host where the server is deployed as the first line.The next lines of the file are the name (2nd line) and password (3rd line) of the database user.

By default, an account with access type "administrator" is registered in the system with login: admin, password: 1234.

Some features require an internet connection.

To perform some functions, a user with an "administrator" access type will also need to move the contents of the www folder to the root folder of the computer's host. 
Next, find the path.txt file in the Proforientir folder and enter the path to the folder where the files from www were transferred.
# Using the software package


At the time of development of the software package in 2020, the new Google privacy policy of 2022 has not yet entered into force, which prohibits access to applications that have not passed OAuth authentication. Therefore, some functions of the software package may not be available.
